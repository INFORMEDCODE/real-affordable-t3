## LMI

LMI calculation is done after the transfer (stamp) duty is removed from the deposit

**Example:**

Inital Deposit = 65000 = **ID**
Property Price = 530000 = **PP**

Transfer Duty = 19200 = **TD**

Real Deposit = ID - TD | (65000 - 19200 = 46800) = **RD**
Updated Loan Value = PP - RD | 530000 - 46800 = 483200 = **ULV**

LMI Cost = LMI Calc | (483200 \* 0.03048 = 14728) = **LC**

Real Loan Value = ULV + LC | 483000 + 14728 = 497728 = **RLV**

### Calculations

Transfer Duty Calc = ((PP - rangeLow) / 100) \* rate + base = TDC

> Where rangeLow is the bracket that the PP falls into

LMI Calc = ULV \* rateAsPercent;

> Where rateAsPercent is the bracket that the loan falls into
